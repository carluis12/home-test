# Selenium Webdriver Automation Test

This is a solution to the challenge, made with Java, Selenium WebDriver, Maven, and TestNG, using the Design Pattern
POM (Page Object Model) and Data-Driven Tests.

This project is based on the following: [Project Requirements](../README.md)

## Quick Overview:

For more information, please check the documentation on:

1. [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp)
2. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)
3. [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/index.html)
4. [Pages Object Model](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/page-object-model-pom-design-pattern-f9588630800b)
5. [Data Driven Test](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/data-driven-framework-in-selenium)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub Repository
2. Install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)  ( _**Important**_:
   This project compile with Java **21**)
3. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven
4. To run the tests there are two options:

- By running the script:

  `       ./run.sh ` and follow the instructions to run the tests


- By using Maven:

  ` mvn install tests  or mvn isntall tests -Dgroup={TestGroup}`

For the **TestGroup** variable, you can use: _REGRESSION, LOGIN, GRID, SEARCH, CHECKOUT_.

## About the test

There are ten tests known as :

1. Every test depends on the data, so the data is loaded from the file  `src/test/resources/testdate/data.json`
2. The tests are divided into groups, so it is possible to run a specific group of tests.

3. The method name is the key of the data, so the data is loaded by the method name.
   For example, the method `loginSuccessfully` will load the data from the key `loginSuccessfully`.

```json 
  {
    "testName": "loginSuccessfully",
    "path": "/login",
    "login": {
      "user": "johndoe19",
      "password": "supersecret"
    }
  }
``` 

This allows having multiple data for the same test method and running the test with different data.

4. The tests have the configuration to start the application in the `BeforeSuite` and close the application in
   the `AfterSuite`.
5. The configuration of the setup and teardown of the test is in the `BrowserConfig` class
6. For different **ENV** variables, the configuration is in the `project.properties` file.
   For example:

```properties
site.url=http://localhost:3100
docker.site.url=http://application:3100
ENVIROMENT=local
HEADLESS=false
```

It is possible to change the URL of the application, the ENV variable, and the HEADLESS mode.

## Reports

This project has two types of reports: Extent Report and Allure Report.
The project generates these reports after the execution of the tests in the path `target/outputfiles/reports/`.

### Allure Report

The report generated by [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) like this:
After the execution of the tests, run the following commands to generate the report:

`mvn allure:report`
`mvn allure:serve`

The report generated looks like this:

### Extent Report

The report [Extent Reports](https://www.extentreports.com/docs/versions/5/java/index.html) generated looks like this:
